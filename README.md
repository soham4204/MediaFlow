# MEDIAFLOW - ðŸš€ Serverless Media Processing Pipeline on AWS

This project demonstrates a highly scalable, event-driven media processing pipeline using various AWS services. It supports file uploads, asynchronous processing, and real-time notifications.

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture Overview

The architecture is divided into the following key layers:

### 1. *User Layer*
- *Client:* Any user-facing application or frontend.
- *API Gateway:* Handles HTTP requests from users.
- *Authentication Service:* Verifies users before allowing access to upload or process data.

### 2. *Storage Layer*
- *S3 Bucket:* Stores uploaded media files.
- *CloudFront (CDN):* Delivers static content like images or processed files quickly to end users.

### 3. *Process Layer*
- *SQS Queue:* Decouples file upload and processing using a message queue.
- *ECS Cluster (Fargate or EC2):* Hosts microservices (e.g., Docker containers) to process uploaded media files.
- *AWS Lambda:* Used for lightweight, serverless executions like image resizing, metadata extraction, or sending alerts.
- *Database (e.g., RDS or DynamoDB):* Stores processed file data, metadata, or user information.
- *Notification Service:* Sends processing status updates to users (e.g., via email, SMS, or push notifications).

### 4. *Monitoring Layer*
- *CloudWatch:* Monitors logs, metrics, and events.
- *Auto Scaling:* Dynamically adjusts ECS instances based on workload.

ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions
## Clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-media-pipeline.git
cd aws-media-pipeline

## Deploy Infrastructure
Use Terraform, AWS CDK, or CloudFormation from the infrastructure/ folder.

## Deploy ECS Services
Containerize your processing service using Docker and deploy to ECS using Fargate or EC2 launch type.

## Deploy Lambda Functions
Upload or deploy using the AWS CLI or the Serverless Framework.

## Configure S3 Event Trigger
Set up S3 to trigger SQS when a new file is uploaded.

## Set Up API Gateway and Auth
Use Amazon Cognito or custom JWT-based auth for API protection.

## Use Cases
### 1. Media processing (images, videos, audio)
### 2. Scalable content delivery
### 3. Asynchronous file processing
### 4. Real-time user notifications

### ðŸ“ˆ Scalability and Monitoring
CloudWatch tracks ECS/Lambda metrics, request logs, and errors.
Auto Scaling ensures services scale based on demand.
SQS decouples components for improved reliability.
